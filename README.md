# Python Port Scanner
This is a basic python script to scan port from 1-65535 for a given IPv4 address. <br>
This is an update to orginal script written by Heath Adams, with minor correction in exception handling.

# Instruction:
1)  git clone https://github.com/cicadacode3301/port_scanner.git
2)  cd port_scanner
3)  chmod +x prt_scanner.py
4)  ./prt_scanner (IPv4 Address)
